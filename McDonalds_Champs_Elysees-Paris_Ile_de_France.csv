"Have to admit I am not a great fan of McDonalds but it is a great place for a quickish snack, I doubt it can really be classed as a 'Fast Food establishment' anymore.The one on the Champs Elysees occupies an ideal position from the Company's point of view just a 100 mtrs from the Arc de Triomphe it is extremely busy, but a large restaurant with an upstairs seating area which means I was coping even at lunchtime.The food was no different to any other McDonalds I have ever visited and well priced compared with any place to eat near a Paris landmark/tourist attraction, we saw coffee on sale near the Eifel Tower at 16 euros per cup, were charge 22 euros for a cup of tea, small beer and small bottle of water more than half a mile from the tower so that in itself is a major point.Ordering is almost totally be card/automatic ordering machine which I personally find a little difficult to understand but would be child's play to most regular uses and there does seem to be ample machines within the takeaway/café, I can't bring myself to call it a restaurant.I found my fillet of fish and fries as always never seem to fill me up and I am by no means a big eater.There is a nice covered area on the pavement outside which must be nice to use in the summer and ok even in February.It is what it it and what it claims to be, nothing better nothing worse, great for McDonalds fans and there are millions of them the friends with us love them and were actively looking for one.","February 29, 2020"
"Food was fine. Staff were undesirably rude!Family outing completely ruined by rude, disrespectful, unpleasant manAVOID!!!!!!!!","February 15, 2020"
We went here to enjoy the Golden Arches fries. Easy to use touch screen ordering. But wish they had cleaning wipes to wash the screens. I sure don’t like the idea of putting my hands on that screen before eating. Then you have pay to use the bathroom. Wasn’t McDonalds finest day,"November 5, 2019"
"When I visited this McDonalds I was excited to see so many options that we don’t have on the menu in Ireland. However my bacon and blue cheese burger and fries were served barely warm (cheese wasn’t even slightly melted and the bun and the burger were both very dry. Also queued 15 minutes to use the toilet as there was only one stall in operation, the others were filthy and blocked. Considering the prices are so high compared to other McDonalds they need to do better. I would not return.","November 2, 2019"
This restaurent was a mad uprade from the one back in the United Kingdom. My travel to France was fancy and made even more fancy when i ventured into this chain. The smell of wine and cheese was not prevelent. I instead smelt burgers and sweaty bodies that were pile driving into this chain. That is what i love after all. BTW if you need any flowers hit me up.This is stop 2 of 195,"October 2, 2019"
The wait for the women's toilet was 15mins. When we finally got in we saw that no one wanted to pay for the toilet so even though there were four stalls only two were in use as people would grab the door in order to not pay. The state of those toilets was disgusting. Trash piled almost waste high and no toilet paper. We paid to use the other toilets and then after ordering found out we could have gotten a token to use the toilet for free. Geez. The ordering process was smooth as everyone used one of the many kiosks to order. Food came very quickly. After ordering we waited about two minutes for our order to come out. The food tastes the same as in the US.,"September 21, 2019"
"Do you know how they call double bigmac in France? - Royal cheese!Good stuff, best burgers in Paris","September 13, 2019"
For a busy location service was fast and friendly and food was well prepared. We really enjoyed the Mac experience in Paris.,"August 26, 2019"
"Staff appear disorganized and unmotivated. Overall poor experience. Have eaten at Macdonalds all over the world... food prep here is also poor. More work in the kitchen and better staff training at the cashes. Staff have a “don’t care “ attitude. One positive note, security person was very pleasant and professional.","August 25, 2019"
"Had two cheese and egg mcmuffins, 2 coffees and some sweet stuff like muffins.was very unhealthy but very yummy.McDonald's was nice and clean, plenty of space to sit, but note that we were there around 8am","August 17, 2019"

"McDonalds is familiar food, quick & easy - so an easy meal when we're travelling. It was our first experience where we ordered completely at the machines - no talking to staff at all. Initially we didn't realise & I can't say staff that were around were very helpful - but in the end we figured it out ourselves anyway. Hubby was very chuffed that he could order a beer with his meal!! The view out onto the Champs Elysees through the huge front window was pretty cool too.","August 1, 2019"

"By far the busiest Macie D's I have been in.Service was very quick.

"The sandwiches were good and the fries but the order takes a very long time to be served and there were no places to sit but the place was clean and I would like to thank the security as I forgot my hand bag in the shop and when I came back after one hour they kept it for me where the bag has my passports and if I lost it , it will be a great problem but they kept it safe for me , thanks a lot ","May 25, 2019"
"We had to try McDonald's in Paris! It was easy to order with their touch screen ordering option. We got the P'TiT Ranch (Really just a crispy ranch snack wrap), LA BOÎTE À PARTAGER, which had 3 different fried items, they had chicken nuggets, chicken strips, and this fried cheese (wasnt a big fan at all for the fried cheese, it was like fried thick cream cheese), and their deluxe potatoes (tasted just like jojos). We tried their ranch, curry and bbq sauce. The curry tasted like a hint of curry, it was interesting, I liked it. The bbq and the ranch was normal.","February 22, 2019"

"All of our hamburgers were cold. (The cheese was never even melted on the burgers), buns weren’t fresh and the French fries were cold. The coffee was the only good thing. $90 euros spent on garbage food.","January 13, 2019"
"While visiting Paris we thought we’d sample the delights of the Golden Arches (white ones anyway) it was terrible. The toilets were disgusting and tiny with one stall for the male toilets and my wife was unable to enter the ladies due to the smell the screens were all stacked with people and you cannot order at the desks which I think is ludicrous, the general cleanliness and hygiene was appalling I would not recommend a visit","October 21, 2018"
"OK, there are many places to grab a more Parisian cup of coffee. Any little cafe will give you a more authentic experience. But, if you are on the Champs Elysees, and need a little nibble, stop in and visit McCafe. Order the petit baguette and you will be surprised that for 2 euros you will get a great treat. 1 small baguette of pretty good quality, actual butter, and a mini jar of Bonne Maman preserves. A very pleasant surprise, and a good deal for 2 euros. ","October 2, 2018"
Tea was good but expensive at 3 euros a cup. But McDonald’s in Paris lets itself down badly for not bothering to maintain its toilets which cost 50 cents or free if you ask for a token if you are a customer. So if you need the toilet don’t go to any McDonald S in Paris!,"September 28, 2018"

"We do not have tator tots available at any McDonald’s I have visited in the states so this was a very exciting offer when seeking late night food in Paris.

"There was not a lot of people, the waiting was long in comparison to others. I wonder how the prices could be higher than in Switzerland just because it's on Champs-Elysee? Moreover, my doublecheese bacon burger didn't even met the standards, it was dry as hell. The more I go to these restaurants, the more I regret it. There much much better burgers around, just go elsewhere.","September 16, 2018"
"Went there because it is affordable and normally you go in and out very quick... well this time we had to wait 45 minutes by the counter, fries were ready and got cold on the tray, my girlfriends cheeseburger got cold as well... when my Signature hamburguer came I had to actually eat it right there standing by the counter so it would not get cold waiting for the realist od the order... the servers were not rude, but showed no emotions.. This is not what one expects in this area..","September 15, 2018"

We wanted to grab something quick to eat as we were only in Paris for one day and wanted to cram in a lot of sightseeing. Having spent a lot of money already we wanted a cheapish lunch. The McDonalds on the Champs Elysees is not like any other I have visited: It is unbelievably busy but we were able to order from a choice of very tasty vegetarian options (a rarity in France) as well as letting the chaps have their meaty burger fix.,"August 20, 2018"

popped in to mcdonalds champs elysees paris whilst on holiday for quick cheap foodthe server was rude ignorant unhelpful impolite and did not understand what was asked of herthere is no proper signs so you are unsure which queue to stand inhave to pay for use of toilets which is ridiculous and disgusting as in the uk you can use the toilets for free,"August 10, 2018"
"Great macarons at McDonalds! We taste tested at a few different places and have to say that McDo is just as good as any and a little less in price. Also, tried the chicken nuggets with curry sauce and liked it! But, the reason we came here was for the view of the Champs-Elysees. If you sit upstairs, it overlooks the Champs-Elysees - great view for a minimum price!","August 4, 2018"

"We were pressed for time and frankly wanting to dine on an American schedule (early). The kiosks took a minute to figure out, but once mastered all was good.

The citadel of American culture right on the Champs-Élysées. It is a Macdonalds. And it means you can get fast service of assured quality. The self ordering system works well. Toilets (coin operated) are very useful especially for women.,"July 18, 2018"
"What a location for an affordable bite. The normal McDonald fare: Burgers, fries, cold drinks and more besides, with access to wi-fi and fantastic views of the main Champs Elysees. A place you could rest, tarry awhile after a busy day.","June 23, 2018"

"McDonald's in Paris definitely doesn't taste like McDonald's in America but I give them an A+ for creativity. I love that you have the option to order from a large computer screen or order from the counter with a live person. This was such a unique experience and their ice cream machine actually worked!..lol Y'all know most American McDonald's ice cream machines are always down when you want a sundae.I loved that they offered unusual items on the menu like potato wedges, macaroons, cold cut sandwiches, curry dipping sauce and you can even get beer!! I saw people ordering Heinekens with their meal and it blew my mind. This is a very busy location. Most likely due to the high tourist volume and shopping malls.","June 19, 2018"
Thank you McDs for free bathrooms and WiFi wherever you are in the world.I’m sorry I only saw fit to try the tangy strawberry cone in Paris but there’s so much other food I’d rather try in that town. That said you’re the MVP when it comes to convenience and reliability. ,"June 4, 2018"

Was walking distance from our hotel. You can see the Arc from there and it was open late. Cashiers did not speak English well. They will call out your order number in French so be sure you are listening and paying attention if you do not speak French very well. ,"March 29, 2018"

"Went there for a family breakfast as normally nothing opens 7am in Paris.Been there till 7:45 and they still wouldnt let us in.Their hours of work are from 7am.Finnally we got inside at around 8! Very very poor staff and food! Ordered what we wanted at the pay machine and been waiting for our order around 20 mins and we still didnt get nothing! I want to mention that this ‘mcdonalds’ was not busy at all as we were one of the first to come in and order.After a long time my wife went to someone to ask if we will get any food,the lady looked very angry,took our receipt and in under 20 sec a 25 euro order was done! I will attach a picture so that u can see how fresh was our food!Very innacurate order,rude staff and finnaly this is not a Mcdonalds! Its a chinese copy! Avoid! ","January 28, 2018"

if you want have a walk in Champ Elysees and have a light meal or fast food it is very good selection to go McDonalds-Champs Elysees where you can have nice view of street on 1st floor or take a seat on walking area to have a view of Triumph and Champs Elysees. The quality and range of foods that you can select is almost the same as other McDonalds while you can purchase by vendor machines as well as standing in ques.,"December 3, 2017"

I have never been to a McDonalds as slow as this one. If you are in a rush then don't bother. The staff are on a massive go slow and the food is just slapped together. If going for brekkie then go somewhere else!,"October 25, 2017"
"Unbelievably slow service, at lunch time on weekend it took 15 minutes to get a normal McChicken meal. There were lots of personnel, but no interaction with the customers. You pay and place the order by yourself at the machines and wait the fifteen minutes in the line with others for your food. Nice interior design did not save it this time.Fries were warm, but not fresh. Burger was Ok. ","October 22, 2017"

"Went there for a family breakfast as normally nothing opens 7am in Paris.Been there till 7:45 and they still wouldnt let us in.Their hours of work are from 7am.Finnally we got inside at around 8! Very very poor staff and food! Ordered what we wanted at the pay machine and been waiting for our order around 20 mins and we still didnt get nothing! I want to mention that this ‘mcdonalds’ was not busy at all as we were one of the first to come in and order.After a long time my wife went to someone to ask if we will get any food,the lady looked very angry,took our receipt and in under 20 sec a 25 euro order was done! I will attach a picture so that u can see how fresh was our food!Very innacurate order,rude staff and finnaly this is not a Mcdonalds! Its a chinese copy! Avoid! ","January 28, 2018"

if you want have a walk in Champ Elysees and have a light meal or fast food it is very good selection to go McDonalds-Champs Elysees where you can have nice view of street on 1st floor or take a seat on walking area to have a view of Triumph and Champs Elysees.

"Unbelievably slow service, at lunch time on weekend it took 15 minutes to get a normal McChicken meal. There were lots of personnel, but no interaction with the customers.

Nice interior design did not save it this time.Fries were warm, but not fresh. Burger was Ok. ","October 22, 2017"

"The food was alright, typical McDonalds quality, cheap, yet good and filling. Being in France, we tried their macarons and they were quite good as well as the flan. The main issue with the place is the service. The lady in charge of the McCafe section made me really uncomfortable. On the one hand, I felt really sorry for her as she had to deal with LOTS of orders mainly on her own and, from own experience, I understood why she was stressed. She needed help. However, she was beyond rude. Asking a customer with a child in a harsh tone ""What do you want?"" is not good customer service, no matter how stressed you are. She was very unhelpful, unorganised and rude, end of story. On the other side of the restaurant, the staff were alright, rather helpful I might say.Overall, I would recommend the place for a cheap eat on Champs Elysees, but expect some not-so-great customer service.","September 9, 2017"

This restaurant was situated around a five minute walk from our hotel and was ideal for getting a quick breakfast each day in order to maximise our time in a Paris.There are security staff at the entrance to conduct bag checks. This applies at most stores on the Champs Elysees and is very reassuring given what the city has experienced in recent times.There are numerous self-serve machines in this restaurant where you can do your order and there are several languages available so it shouldn't be an issue. You can elect to pay on credit/debit card on the machine or elect to pay cash. If you go for this it prints out a receipt and you then go to one of the counters and pay the staff accordingly.The food was absolutely fine and there is plenty of seating available upstairs. There is even a separate enclosed room on this level which is a quiet space. Wifi was nice and fast here.,"July 17, 2017"

"Fries were bang on, nuggets were crispy and delicious in a sachet of ketchup, triple cheeseburger was 3 times as good as a regular cheeseburger, the fanta was perfect with a great amount of ice. All in all an excellent visit - would visit again","February 16, 2017"
"This McDonalds is pretty large compared to the other ones. It's close to Arc de Triomphe, not a bad choice if you want to grab a meal real quick. The thing is that this place is pretty crowded, so expect a long line. Things can get chaotic with so many people but there's always someone from the staff to help you. Just be ready to wait really long for the food. Not much to say about the food itself, those who like burgers and wraps will be satisfied. And I highly recommend the delicious macaroons, try all of them.","January 28, 2017"
"Really location (really near to the Arc de Triumph), good space with a great view of the Champs Elysees Avenue. Nice place to have cheap meals and taste the French macaroni. ","January 18, 2017"
Not your typical McDonalds to say the least! The restaurant was far posher to that than you are used to from McDonalds. Very well furnished and a good variety with a separate McCafe bar. Plenty of seating area and some very nice seats upstairs near the window allowing for a nice view over the busy strip. Much better to get a coffee here and watch the world go by than in a cafe where you would probably be paying €3+ more.,"January 11, 2017"
"This place was bammin slammin spectacular. The food here was bomb as hell, and the robo-service was gucci af. Definitely giving this joint 5 green circles out of 5. Better than that thot Wendy's.

We wanted a quick bite and a wrap and burger sounded good. This place is terribly crowded. I waited in long line to place an order at the kiosks but then it declined my US credit card. I waited 20 minutes to order at the counter then it was another 30 minutes to get our food. After that it was a wait to find an open table only to discover our fries we cold and had no salt. Normally I would have returned to complain and get hot fries but the thought of battling the crowds only to talk to someone that won't understand English changed my mind.I have walked past this place many times and I will not return. I cannot recommend it either,"December 28, 2016"
Comically slow service (food took nearly 45 minutes to actually arrive). The queue for picking up orders was incredibly disorganised and chaotic with no one seemingly in charge or taking responsibility. And more generally it seemed like no one really knew what was going on. Could be solved quite easily by having a screen displaying which order number is ready to be picked up. ,"December 27, 2016"
When you consider the location on the Champs Elysees you would expect it to be busy but over a 30 minute wait for an incorrectly filled order and then no seating - avoid.,"December 20, 2016"
This McDonald's is the worse I have ever been too had to wait 30 mins for food and when we got it it was cold undercooked and awful tried to complain no one gets back to you on messenger and no email address to send complaint too just a postal address which I will do as soon as I get time to write avoid ,"November 19, 2016"
The food is very very good but the staff is very slow and there isn't photos for the meals like any Mcdonalds in the world just a screen with a very small font for meal explanation but very annoying and fast I can't catch what i want and with no photos for the meals ,"October 29, 2016"

It is interesting to see the how the lines and row of kiosks operate. There is even a section of lovely pastries. It is a great place to stop, take a load off your feet, watch the people, and use the free public restroom. The restroom was a stop after the Big Red Bus Tour. It is ALWAYS a great idea to bring a package of hand bacterial sanitary wipes with you. A Big Mac is a Big Mac; and the fries are McDonald’s fries.

"McDonald's in Paris is very different from the US. We ate there twice once for breakfast because they were one of the first places to open, and still being on US time we had already been up for awhile. We also ate lunch there.

"The food is standard McDonald's, OK, and like all Paris McDonald's can be ordered via self-service machine. However, beware that there are two branches of McDonald's on the Champs Elysées.

They have many pastries including muffins, macaroons, cakes, etc. They even put the macaroons in a cute little box. They are half the price you would pay if you bought them in most other cafes.

We actaually ate here twice when we visited Champs Elysees. I found the place to be perfectly clean all the tables were being constantly cleaned and rubbish removed. What I liked about it is you can order your food on a machine and set it in your own language so you can clearly see and look at the menu and what your options are rather than panic deciding when you are at the front counter. The service was quick and efficient you can order on the machine and then go to collect your order and you have a number so it is easy. Upstairs there is loads of seating and a lovely row at the front where you have a lovely view of all the shops and lights at night.,"April 3, 2016"

"The actual McDonalds was like you would expect most McDonalds to be, it was modern with screens to order your food.The toilets were disgusting, all of the cubicles had a pile of sanitary towels and tampons piled up on top of each bin next to the toilet.I thought as first it was just one cubicle but on checking each one and nearly gagging I realised each one was like it and I could only find one with toilet paper. I was so shocked I was going to go back in with my phone to take pictures but I just couldn't face it. Absolutely shocked and appalled that the womens toilets could get into such a state in a modern European city, I used the loo because I was bursting and didn't know where I would find another another. Shocking that so much is being spent of getting the latest state of the art ordering systems and screens and they can#t even keep on top of keeping the Sanitary bins emptied, shame on you McDonalds.","February 23, 2016"
"After ordering at the screen at the entrance, it took them almost half an hour to give me my burger. I think they lost my order somehow, and after 20 mins I asked one of the managers to check. He said he would do his but never returned! Very bad service! 10 min later I asked again the girl at the counter and she gave me my burger after seeing that it was ordered 30 minutes before. Do not go here!","May 15, 2016"
Grab a window table and something to drink and watch the people go by. But I have never seen so many people in a McD's. In addition to cashiers there are large touch screens you can order on. A total zoo for a non-French speaker but also great entertainment.,"May 7, 2016"

Great food great people you can't beat the scenery! I think the people who work at these places make the biggest difference!!!,"April 25, 2016"
We actaually ate here twice when we visited Champs Elysees. I found the place to be perfectly clean all the tables were being constantly cleaned and rubbish removed. What I liked about it is you can order your food on a machine and set it in your own language so you can clearly see and look at the menu and what your options are rather than panic deciding when you are at the front counter. The service was quick and efficient you can order on the machine and then go to collect your order and you have a number so it is easy. Upstairs there is loads of seating and a lovely row at the front where you have a lovely view of all the shops and lights at night.,"April 3, 2016"

"You can't go wrong with McDonald's. Wherever you go in the world. When you just need a quick bite to eat. Without risking food poisoning or major disappointment. Chicken McNuggets.

"Dirty bathrooms and no hand wash. Frequented here three times, and same everytime.The ordering system is absolutely terrible. It's like they care more about appearance than a smooth service.

The desserts were overly sweet. The mango smoothie was filled about 3/4 cup full. The iced coffee was so sweet with syrup that it was unpalatable.Then I ordered a few sandwiches with the rapid order. French fries tasted fine, like American fries. Had to ask for ketchup. The sandwich was a new chicken sandwich (the cheapest on the menu, about 5 Euros for the sandwich---$6.50) with mustard.

The Best Cappuccino ever I have drink in Europe. Every day in the morning the first thing I want is my Cappuccino and croissant pastries. McCafe was the best with a lot of excellent quality of pastries. Recommended to try it in the morning,"September 1, 2013"
Great atmosphere and great bakery treats! Great value. Convenient location. Good place to go between tours and shopping breaks. Generally can find an employee who speaks English. Staff friendly and very helpful. Would recommend to friends on a budget.,"August 22, 2013"
"McDonald's close to the Arc de Triomph, perpetually crowded (as in no tables available, bumping elbows left and right), long line for poorly ventilated, bad smelling and slippery bathrooms.There is a separate station for ordering smoothies, iced coffee, macaroons and other desserts. The desserts were overly sweet. The mango smoothie was filled about 3/4 cup full. The iced coffee was so sweet with syrup that it was unpalatable.Then I ordered a few sandwiches with the rapid order. French fries tasted fine, like American fries. Had to ask for ketchup. The sandwich was a new chicken sandwich (the cheapest on the menu, about 5 Euros for the sandwich---$6.50) with mustard. Meat was dry but baguette was good. Big Mac was 8 Euros. Meanwhile, people hovering around, trying to sit down. Very unpleasant experience.","August 18, 2013"

The supervisor was so stubborn, aggressive, defensive and offensive (I just could not believe what I heard and what I saw) I then stepped in and joined the other customers in a trial to correct this rude Supervisor's attitude and ask for the duty manager, he replied we have no duty manager, I then asked him about his name, he replied that his name was mr Mc Donald's, he even got so close to me and almost touched me and said that he will not allow me to eat in his restaurant.

I saw the Easy Order machine all over and thought I should try to use it. Everything went smoothly up to this point. Even the order slip was in EnglishIt was a disaster at the collection counter, I was a visitor and did not speak a word of French. The counter staff was shouting out the order number in Fench. After waiting for 15 minutes, I went up to the collection counter. The lady manager was there shouting out numbers. Her face was furious, she was throwing stuff including burgers around. After a few shouts of the same number, if there were no respond, she would shoved the tray and say something in French like cursing with angry face. I got her attention and asked if she would call the order number out in English. Her face crunched up and told me, 'YOU just wait over there'. I repeated twice my question to her to ask if she would call the order number out in English as I couldn't understand French. She later said, 'I SAY Yes! You wait there'. Very well, I waited. Nothing was called out in English even though McD's system did differentiate orders made in different languages (that's what I gathered from standing next to her screen)I was stuck! Standing there 30 mins and not sure if my order has come. Anyway, I decided to look at the orders they 'shoved' out to see any was mine. After a long wait, I saw something like my order. Then a staff shouted something in French. I showed her my tickets without knowing a word she said but I finally got my food.How can McD not invest in a numbering board, orders to be collected just need to be shown on the board and customer will go collect.

"OK, the Mc Donald's itself is pretty nice, and furnitures rather fancy. But for Charles De GAULLE's sake, anywhere but not on the Champs Elysées. Please, cross the street and go to Fouquet's - a bit more expensive though. ","July 11, 2012"
nothing surprise just McDonald's on Champs Elysees street,"June 12, 2012"
Service is really slow for a busy part of Paris some cashiers are closed during peak times ,"May 10, 2012"
Nice place and works up to 2am. Very crowded and sell typical mac meals. Has McCafe inside that sell macaroon (Nice addition to Mac options).,"April 21, 2012"
"we visited at friday 060412, took long time before we were asked by a lady what we want to order, when we reached the counter it was after more as 20 minutes waiting, from the side came three young people one girl and two arab guys they talked to the girl at the counter Stepahnie and persuaded her to help them first, the girl forget us and started to help the guys, the guys were mistreated us with words and talked to us like we were small kids, it took another 20 minutes before we could show our ticket to order, the girl behind the counter was not sure about our order and did a lot of wrong things. We were with an older person but if we were together we had run away before.i visit paris twice a year but will never visit this place before, you are Warned to forget this place because they mistreat youas we asked for a manager to complain they told us there was nonethe food was cold , too cold to eat","April 10, 2012"
"Kind of sad to see this giant taking over in Paris. BUT I do have to say their macarons are very good. I've heard it said that LaDuree makes them! If possible, don't get them here, though; other McDonald locations charge much less than does this location. And I do like their separate coffee bar with any specialty coffee you could want. The free bathroom is an added bonus, but it is not kept up at all. And seating is at a premium; I saw people almost come to a yelling match over a table here. Not a place to relax after going to the Arc or shopping!","April 8, 2012"
Had no place to sit was over crowded! And the worst was that the chairs and tables were dirty and there was no one to clean it up! Stale food!,"July 25, 2012"
"Same menu as at every other McDo -- but a great location! Try the Big Mac! Or the Royal Deluxe, which is my personal favorite.","July 24, 2012"

We were staying with our children in Disney and took the train in to central Paris. Got off at the Champs Elysee and started to walk down the road when the skies opened and it was like a monsoon. Dashed in here to get shelter and lunch and managed to get a table upstairs at the window. Great view from up there. Typical McDonalds fayre. ,"February 26, 2012"
"MacDo lovers stay home or eat French!!...The Champs Elycee is French so lets all get rid of foreign fast food, bergers and pizzas, off one of the world's most famous landmarks....s'il vous plait .....bring back the rude bistro waiters and real French fries instead of the pre-fab junk food...be a real tourist and try local cuisine and let the Parisians have back their Champs Elysee!!!

This place was packed for lunch. More registers going than any U.S. Mcdonalds. Try they pastries. Yes pastries. Real French pastries in a 10 foot long glass pastry cabinet. Fun to watch the young people of France at Mcdonalds. They dress so much better than the average American of the same age. Always a scarf and tall boots.,"January 31, 2012"

"We were surprised to find a McD in Paris with a cafe sitting area on the Champs-Elysees. Food lines inside were long and food was not inexpensive, much higher than at McD's in US. We finally got our food and took it outside, only to wait another 15 min. for a table so food was cold. Unfortunately no awning so garbage on tables and floor attracted pigeons. One employee came out once to make a half-hearted attempt to clear dirty tables. We were also interrupted six times by beggars (not McDonald's fault but still irritating.) There are many other restaurant choices on the Champs-Elysees that are less expensive and food is fresher, cafes are cleaner.","September 10, 2009"
We stopped when we were walking by because we had never seen such a large McDonalds with multiple floors. They even had a French bakery with croissants and pastries. Tables allow for a great view of the Champs Elysees and a wonderful break!,"February 7, 2009"
